// Exercise 1: Basic Variable Declarations
// 1. Declare a variable named `age` with the type number and assign your age to it.
// 2. Declare another variable named `name` with the type string and assign your name to it.
// 3. Print both variables in a sentence like "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old."



// Exercise 2: Simple Array Usage
// 1. Create an array named `colors` that can hold strings.
// 2. Fill the array with the names of three colors.
// 3. Print the first color in the array.



// Exercise 3: Basic Function to Add Numbers
// 1. Write a function named `addNumbers` that takes two parameters, both of type number, and returns their sum.
// 2. Call the function with two numbers of your choice and print the result.



// Exercise 4: Using Enums for Days of the Week
// 1. Create an enum named `Weekday` with values representing the days of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
// 2. Declare a variable using the `Weekday` enum to represent today and assign it a day.
// 3. Print the value of today's day using the enum.



// Exercise 5: Conditional Logic in Functions
// 1. Create a function named `isAdult` that takes an age (number) as a parameter and returns "Adult" if the age is 18 or over, and "Minor" if under 18.
// 2. Call the function with two different ages and print the results.



// Exercise 6: Looping Over Arrays
// 1. Create an array named `pets` with the types set to string, and fill it with the names of three different pets.
// 2. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the `pets` array and print each pet's name with a message like "Pet name: [petName]."



// Exercise 7: Using the `any` Type
// 1. Declare a variable named `mixedBag` with the type `any` and initialize it with an array containing different types of values (e.g., a number, a string, and a boolean).
// 2. Print the entire `mixedBag` array.
// 3. Change the first item in the `mixedBag` to a different type of value and print the array again.



// Exercise 8: Simple Conditional Statements
// 1. Declare a variable named `temperature` with the type number and assign it a value.
// 2. Write an `if-else` statement that checks the `temperature`:
//    - If the temperature is above 30, print "It's hot outside."
//    - If the temperature is between 10 and 30, print "It's a nice day."
//    - Otherwise, print "It's cold outside."
// 3. Change the value of `temperature` to test different outcomes.
